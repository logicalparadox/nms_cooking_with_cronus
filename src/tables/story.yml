          <NEU_AVG>Upon approaching the entity, Cronus questions if we have met 
          before, explaining...<>


          "Hmm... Nada and Polo sometimes change things. Granted, it's usually for the
          better. And recently, an alchemist has been bringing in shipments of<> 
          <FLORA>NipNip Buds<>. What a fascinating plant... Does wonders for my 
          mood, terrible on my memory."


          <NEU_AVG>Their attention drifts for a moment, before snapping back to 
          the conversation.<>


          "Oh, right! Greetings and salutations Traveler! I am the iteration known 
          as Cronus. Trader in rare cuisine, professional food critic, and 
          amaetuer whalesong tracker."

      - $Entry: >-
          <NEU_AVG>When asked about rare cousine...<>


          "Whether it's <%~ foodNames[0] %> or <%~ foodNames[3] %>, I'm always 
          looking to expand my portfolio. What I am looking to acquire changes 
          from day to day, so be sure to stop by if you haven't been in the Nexus 
          recently.


          I also coordinate the Ingredients Market for settlements in the region, 
          if you have a moment to spare. Fair compensation and competitive prices 
          for all your certified organic ingredient needs."


          <NEU_AVG>You are sure you have heard this in a recent galactic broadcast.<>

          <NEU_AVG>When asked about food critiques...<>


          "That is dangerous territory my friend! Many have brought their finest
          works before me, and most have not dared to again.


          Should you prepare something interesting I will offer you the same services, 
          but know that the cost is my honest opinion."

      - $Entry: >-
          <NEU_AVG>When asked about whalesong...<>


          "The galaxy outside this Nexus has recently experienced a migration of the
          most fascinating megafauna. Space-faring and warp capable! Furthermore, 
          if the rumors are believed to be true, also highly intelligent."


          "What do they eat? Do they prefer <%~ foodNames[1] %> or <%~ foodNames[2] %>? 
          Or perhaps <%~ foodNames[4] %>! Pah. Enough speculation. Let us work together 
          on other matters, then we can discuss this topic further."

      - $Entry: >-
          "Before you go, take a <TECHNOLOGY>Nutrient Processor<> and 
          construction plans. Consider it an investment."


          "The galaxy out there isn't all hazardous rainstorms and murderous 
          robots. There is also good food to be had, especially if you know how 
          to prepare it properly!"

      # The cooking scene
      - $Title: The Offering
        $Entry: >-
          <NEU_AVG>When asked about whalesong...<>


          "What fortuitus circumstances we find ourselves in. I theorize that 
          within the wake of these cosmic beings are memories, lost even to them. 
          If we could attune to these memories, it would capture the attention 
          of a nearby migratory fleet."


          "Now, a scientist would have you construct all sorts of instrumentation 
          and devices. Discordant and cold things that would only alienate, not 
          invite. These are living creatures and if we wish to make new friends, 
          that is always best done over the finest of foods. I will prepare a 
          dessert! One of such magnificence that it will sing of all that the 
          stars have seen."


          <NEU_AVG>Cronus stops in full crescendo and looks in the direction of 
          the other Nexus denizens. Statisfied no others caught this moment of 
          untethered excitement, Cronus continues in a whisper.<>


          "And you, Traveler, will carry it beyond the Nexus to whomever comes 
          seeking it's call. But you must promise to return and tell me what 
          ecrets this galaxy has forgotten."


          <NEU_AVG>You agree to this task.<>

      - $Entry: >-
          <NEU_AVG>The Chef's voice trails off as they pull seemingly random food 
          items from crates scattered throughout the market stall. You try to make 
          note of the recipe but Cronus never measures a single ingredient as they 
          weave from one<> <TECHNOLOGY>Nutrient Processor<> <NEU_AVG>to the next.<>


          <NEU_AVG>Finally, placed before you is a gently-baked<> <SPECIAL>meringue<>, 
          <NEU_AVG>a bowl of<> <SPECIAL>custard<><NEU_AVG>, and small dish of<> 
          <SPECIAL>jam<> <NEU_AVG>that changes color whenever you look away.<>


          "The <TECHNOLOGY>Nutrient Processors<> would get this last part wrong."
          <NEU_AVG>Cronus expains,<> "Each <SPECIAL>offering<> is different.
          It wants to sing, and you must help it find it's voice."


          <NEU_AVG>As Cronus sculpts the <><SPECIAL>offering's<> <NEU_AVG>final 
          form, a hum begins to resonates from the dessert before you. The hum 
          becomes a voice, then the voice becomes a chorus. Barely audible but 
          always present.<> 


          <VISOR>You wonder if you have you heard this song before.<>


          "There you go, my friend! I can modestly say that it is one of my finest 
          desserts yet.Now, if you would be so kind, it would like to 
          <SPECIAL>harmonize<> with the stars."

      - $Title: Forgotten Songs
        $Entry: >-
          <NEU_AVG>A colossal, glorious creature drifts by my starship, appearing to swim 
          through the vacuum of space. A haze of stardust glitters around it. 
          It is like nothing I have ever seen. Serenity and peace wash over me 
          in the presence of this ancient creature. It feels profoundly familiar, 
          as though we have always known each other.<>


          <VISOR>"Traveller. In the infinity of fates, we have converged."<>"


          <NEU_AVG>The whale-like creature opens its throat. A resonant lullaby sweeps 
          over me, bathing my consciousness in waves of euphoria.<>


          "Come, let us dream together. Who are you in this life?"


          <NEU_AVG>Its melodic voice, simulated directly in my mind, feels 
          natural and soothing. The creature's lullaby draws me onwards. My body 
          is its body. I am swimming with weightless limbs, across an ocean of 
          stars.<>


          "Your warp to my weft, woven together in the cosmic tapestry. I am 
          glad for this song you have brought me."

      - $Entry: >-
          <NEU_AVG>The song recedes, reality re-asserting itself.<>


          "I have seen your fate intertwine with mine many times over, my friend. 
          Should I join your freighter's fleet once again?"

      # Unlocked after returning to cronus after the first encounter
      - $Title: Remembered Dreams
        $Entry: >-
          "My friend! You walk as if you are in a daze. Is everything alright?"


          <NEU_AVG>Cronus tilts their head inquisitively, then a smile forms across their broad face.
          In this moment of recognition, their mood shifts to one of unreserved glee.<>


          "The Sea of Stars will grant it's secrets to those who witness the harmony of songs.
          But knowledge hoarded is knowledge lost. You must share your story.
          Quickly now, before the dream fades away."

      # The Encounter
      - $Entry: >-
          <NEU_AVG>I tell Cronus of the moment I opened up my mind to the<> <SPECIAL>Offering of a Forgotten Song<>.
          <NEU_AVG>I explain the guidance of the Song as I adjusted my ship's trajectory to an unknown point in space.<>


          <NEU_AVG>And I speak of the choir, not just from the offering, but from my entire ship as I engaged 
          the <><TECHNOLOGY>Pulse Drive<> <NEU_AVG>to our destination.<>

      # Cronus' thoughts of forgotten songs and galaxy secrets
      - $Entry: >-
          <NEU_AVG>I describe the majestic creature bathed in stardust that came to answer the call of harmony.
          As I describe the experience, each moment of the dream returns to me.<>


          <NEU_AVG>In this moment, I can still hear the <><VISOR>WHALESONG HARMONY<>.
          <NEU_AVG>What was once a hazy dream manifests as tangible memories, my mind commiting them to permanence.<>


          "...to share such a boon is remarkable!"


          <NEU_AVG>Cronus smiles, realizing I only just returned to the conversation from the depths of my memories.<>


          "There are many more <SPECIAL>Forgotten Songs<> the galaxy has yet to share with us. When you are ready I will help you find them.
          Also, please accept this gift for a story well told."

      # Learning the recipe
      - $Title: The Sea of Stars
        $Entry: >-
          I have purchased the recipe for <SPECIAL>Offering of a Forgotten Song<>.


          "I will miss the stories, but I cannot stand in the way of your discovery. Here you are my friend, please help the universe remember."
